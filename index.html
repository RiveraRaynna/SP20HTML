<section><p>This type of curl pattern is <i>wavy</i> and <i>lacks</i> volume/texture. It is best to use hair products that are light and will <b>not</b> weigh down your hair any further. <strong>Type 2A</strong> being the lightest, use products like moose or gel on the ends. For <strong>Type 2B</strong>, use product starting from the root and make your way down the shaft with a light hand. For <strong>Type 2C</strong>, use a generous amount of product but still keeping with a lighter formula to prevent product buildup.</p></section>
